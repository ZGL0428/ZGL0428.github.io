## Design Manifesto - Zachary Ludwig

#### My code of ethics

  a. **Honesty**

This point should go past the realm of design. No matter what I am doing, **being honest** is high on my list of priorities. When conducting my usability tests, contextual inquiries, and other interviews for our design, our **group made sure to always be open and upfront about what we were doing and our goals.** We also **let our participants know that we were taking notes and recording their actions.** It may be cliche to say that “Honesty is the best policy,” but in my mind, **Honesty is the only policy for design.** Nobody wins when they don’t know **the full details of what** they may be consenting to, and participants may be able to help with the design process if they know more.

  b. **Consent**

Almost an extension of my focus on honesty, consent is key to my design process. While it might sound cool to do “undercover testing,” not informing test subjects of the fact that they are being watched is as unethical as it is harmful to the design process. **I would run the risk of violating my subject’s privacy without consent, and I get more out of each test when subjects know what sort of information will help with our design process.**



  c. **Credit**

Once you finish your design, give credit! I took influence from many people, sources, and designs when playing my part in researching and designing for the HM Convenience Map, and I thus made sure to **give credit for those influences where it was due.** Stealing is never the answer, and **most will be happy that their ideas are being recognized and used to make further advancements in their field.**



#### Everything happens for a reason

**I never keep my head down** when things go bad in the design process, as it will always be harmful to my progress. “Everything happens for a reason” is thus a great quote to live by when researching and designing, since living by it lets me keep my head up and look for opportunities when things seem to have gone wrong. **Looking at my failures like they are just failures and nothing more means I will miss chances for learning, new ideas, and inspiration hidden in the supposed mess**, severely limiting the potential of my design.


#### It's always better together

**Collaboration, collaboration, collaboration.** If you can’t tell, I believe that working with others is key to the design process. This was a key part of my design process for the HM Convenience Map, working with Sari and Sawyer, and **the ability for us to bounce ideas off of each other is what made our final project what it was.** Sawyer had the idea of a map, and I had the idea of providing access to printers, and it was Sari who first mentioned the importance of charging our phones. **Without a single cog in this machine, our final product would never have been as complete as it was.** Further, with different skills in coding, design, and writing, all of our class assignments always had someone with expertise in the area working on it. Thus, in the future, I will always work to design with a team!



#### Accountability and setting goals

Two potentially separate topics go hand in hand when designing. On its own, I realize accountability is important, especially in a group setting. Each member of the group needs to be doing their job for the final product to be completed, and my group, the Convenience Captains, used a text group chat for that purpose. The same goes for setting goals. Looking back at the process of designing the HM Convenience Map, if my only task had been to produce the final project, I would have said “Impossible.” However, with smaller goals laid in front of us, our group was able to take step after step until we reached the final goal. Together, however, the impact on a design process is crazy. **Smaller goals not only kept us accountable, as deadlines for each made sure the entire group stayed focused, but they also motivated us for the longer road ahead.**



#### Iterative design and continuous progress

On that note, the last main point that defines my design process is in the name “iterative design.” These designs are made of many smaller steps, each its own iteration, which can be seen in the Convenience Captains' website
[here](https://hmappdevproject.github.io). Making goals helps with having separate iterations to make, 
but the idea of these iterations is more so one of continuous process. Since we only needed to make one change to have a whole new iteration, **the ease of adding to our project allowed our design to evolve at any point, within or outside of the scope of our goals.** In future designs, I will have to make sure it is easy to add bits and pieces so any idea, no matter how small, gets incorporated.
