### This is a post!

In this post, I will **demonstrate** my ability to _use_ markdown and [github](github.com).
See, some of the stuff that I jsut did in that line is **_really cool._**

Here is a picture of [the worst offensive coordinator in football.](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1RLsOquo1gmDhVCrkTCoyCsR-s=/2595x0:5338x4749/1200x800/filters:focal(3326x237:4504x1415)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69686352/1279690912.0.jpg)
His run blocking scheme is _really bad._

Anyways, I'm sorry for ranting about football, but I put my **Markdown** Skills on full display!
