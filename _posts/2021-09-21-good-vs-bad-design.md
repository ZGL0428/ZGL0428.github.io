## Good vs. Bad Design

#### Good Design

To me, smartphones are some of the best examples of good design because of their extremely clear mapping and extreme affordances. With the mapping, the places you touch on the sreen map to exactly that: the places you touch on the screen. Controls are very easy when they directly mirror your own movements are space. Second, with the affordances, a smartphone lets you access the internet with a dicice that fits inside your hand. This means that what ever the internet affords you, a smartphone affords you to. It is a genious way to let you access materials not even stored on your phone.

#### Bad Design

This mouse is a blatant example of bad technological design. one the one hand, unlike many modern divices, it sacrifices availiability for looks, and it cannot be used while charging. While many other wireless mice have their charging ports in places such that they can still connect to the charger while working, this one attempts to keep a clean front while moving the port to the back, inadvertently harming the UX. Furthermore, the mouse lacks signifiers for its affordances, not showing where to click, the two sides of the mouse, or how to perform certian actions with the mouse. This is especialy an issue for new buyers of the product, potentialy leading to Apple users buying non-apple alternatives.
