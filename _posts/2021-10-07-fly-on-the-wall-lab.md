#### Observations

As I was walking around Horace Mann School, I made a couple of observations about the interactions of daily life at Horace Mann. As a short summary, Horace Mann school is an environment where both academic and “fun” interactions are used for. When looking at two centers of student life, the Library and the Field, I noticed that most of the users were students, each of whom undergoes a very rigorous lifestyle. However, they were able to both have fun and do work in both locations. Coches in the Library and soccer nets on the field facilitated fun, while desks, tents, and computers facilitated studying. I observed that life at Horace Mann was a duality, where both school and fun can shine though in the same environments. People were often stressed, but at the same time others could be having the time of their lives with their friends. It is also important to note that while H period had less work being done, other times of the day were more used for last minute studying and assignments.

#### Insights, Questions, and Theories

With this dichotomy, I believe that almost all of my observations can be grouped by whether they were academic or more relaxed and fun. Environments were split up, with the Katz Library’s top floor more being used for studying while the bottom floor was more used for social interactions. Users fell into different categories at different times, with some studying in the same place as others who were playing sports. Different interactions, activities, and objects could also be split up in the same way. This led me to the following question: __Is this intentional? Were these key centers of student life designed to fulfill both of these needs of the student body?__

*The answer is yes.*

I theorize that the school was designed for what we can call a __balanced lifestyle.__ The school knows that the students are often stressed with work, so they design their environments to help with that, in two ways. The parts of spaces designed for fun help students relax, play, and socialize and lower their stress levels that way, while the areas designed for work allow students uninterrupted time and give them the resources to do their work, lowering the burden on their back.

#### The Process

Now that you know what I found and what I think, I’d like to describe how I got there. Walking around with Jacob Silverstein and Sam Korff, two of my classmates, we visited Horace Mann’s Alumni Field and Katz Library, pictured below (before covid, when the tents were added) for reference.

In terms of methodology, methods that worked were us trying to take a lot of observations, but we figured out early on that recording every little thing would not be a great idea. We really got going when we tried to look for observations of users undergoing interactions that were common to our everyday lives.

Finaly, what did I learn? Through the process, I learned that observing is an important step to understanding your environment. Moreover, raw observations aren’t extremely useful, and you should follow up on your observations with new, additional thoughts. I further realized things about the design of Hiorace Mann, and realized what I could find when using a design mindset.
